## How to install

I'm a little tired today, so I'll just put everything in a paragraph. (since I'm too lazy to decorate it with md)

First, you click on the *Code* button in the top-right corner of this repository. Then, you click *Download ZIP*. After that, you extract your ZIP and open the Terminal in where ever you extracted your ZIP into, and then run one of these commands:
